Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all free open standards.
The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet.
It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages.
 Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in web services.

XML Namespaces provide a method to avoid element name conflicts.
When using prefixes in XML, a so-called namespace for the prefix must be defined.
The namespace is defined by the xmlns attribute in the start tag of an element.
The namespace declaration has the following syntax. xmlns:prefix="URI".

In computing, a uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name of a resource.
URLs:
A URL is a URI that, in addition to identifying a web resource, specifies the means of acting upon or obtaining the representation, specifying both its primary access mechanism and network location.
 For example, the URL http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page refers to a resource identified as /wiki/Main_Page whose representation, in the form of HTML and related code, obtainable via HyperText Transfer Protocol (http) from a network host whose domain name is example.org.

URNs:
A URN is a URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace.
A URN can be used to talk about a resource without implying its location or how to access it.
