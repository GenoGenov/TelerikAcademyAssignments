        <p class="text-justify">
The City's called Duke
And New Mexico, the state.
Among the gangsters,
His fame has greatly spread
'Cause of a new drug 
That the gringos have created.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
They say it is colored blue
And that it's pure in quality,
That powerful drug
That is running through the town
And the owners of the market
Couldn't stop it.
        </p>

        <p>
The cartel's running hot because
They were disrespected,
They talk 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who now controls the market.
No one knows a thing about him
Since they have never seen him.
        </p>

        <p>
The cartel's about respect
And they have never forgiven.
This homie's already dead
He just hasn't been told so.
        </p>


        <p>
Heisenberg's fame
Has reached down to Michoacán.
From way over there they want to come,
to taste that crystal.
That blue stuff has gone international.
        </p>

        <p>
Now New Mexico's name is well suited.
Now it looks just like Mexico
'Cause of all the drugs it's hiding,
Except there's a gringo boss,
as "Heisenberg" he's known.
        </p>

        <p>
The cartel's running hot because
They were disrespected,
They talk 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who now controls the market.
No one knows a thing about him
Since they have never seen him.
        </p>

        <p>
From the fury of the cartel
No one has ever escaped.
This homie's already dead
He just hasn't been told so.
        </p>
