I've been watching you
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
C'mon
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
Hey

Standing across the room I saw you smile
I said I want to talk to yo-o-ou, for a little while
But before I make my move my emotions start running wild
My tongue gets tied and that's no lie
I'm looking in your eyes, I'm looking in you big brown eyes
Ooh yeah, and I've got this to say to you, hey

Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it some more
Girl, I want to make you sweat, sweat till you can't sweat no more
And if you cry out, I'm gonna push it, push it, push it some more

A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long
C'mon
A la la la la long, a la la la la long long li long long long, ooh
