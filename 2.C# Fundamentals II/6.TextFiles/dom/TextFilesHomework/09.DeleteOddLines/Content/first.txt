Are you crazy?
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again
I'll pick up the pieces you left
I ain't your mister, no

Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again

Nothing sounds more better than "Hit the road, Jack" (Jack)
Love me now, my name is bigger
Look what you did
Are you crazy?
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'
Are you crazy?
Are you joking? Must be joking
No no no no no no no no no no no [2x]
No no no no no no no no no no no [2x]
You don't understand

Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again (start again)

Are you crazy?
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again
No no no no no no no no no no no [2x]
