Top 3 most popular programming languages of 2013:

1.Java 
Features of C# Absent in Java
C# includes more primitive types and the functionality to catch arithmetic exceptions.

Includes a large number of notational conveniences over Java, many of which, such as operator overloading and user-defined casts, are already familiar to the large community of C++ programmers.

Event handling is a "first class citizen"—it is part of the language itself.

Allows the definition of "structs", which are similar to classes but may be allocated on the stack (unlike instances of classes in C# and Java).

C# implements properties as part of the language syntax.

C# allows switch statements to operate on strings.

C# allows anonymous methods providing closure functionality.

C# allows iterator that employs co-routines via a functional-style yield keyword.

C# has support for output parameters, aiding in the return of multiple values, a feature shared by C++ and SQL.

C# has the ability to alias namespaces.

C# has "Explicit Member Implementation" which allows a class to specifically implement methods of an interface, separate from its own class methods. This allows it also to implement two different interfaces which happen to have a method of the same name. The methods of an interface do not need to be public; they can be made to be accessible only via that interface.

C# provides integration with COM.

Following the example of C and C++, C# allows call by reference for primitive and reference types.

2.C
C - an older programming language that is described as Hands-on. As the programmer you must tell the program to do everything. Also this language will let you do almost anything. It does not support object orriented code. Thus no classes. 
C# - Full object orriented code resembling the style of C/C++ code. This is really closer to JAVA. C# is the latest version of the C style languages and is very good for developing web applications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.C++
C++ - an extention language per se of C. In C code ++ means increment 1. Thus C++ is better than C. It allows for highly controlled object orriented code. Once again a very hands on language that goes into MUCH detail.

4.C#
C# (pronounced “C-Sharp”) was developed by Microsoft in 2000 as a fundamental part of its .NET framework. C# is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language that combines the best of C and C++. Learning C# is a must for any programmer who wants to develop for Microsoft platforms (including Windows).

C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables
developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications
that run on the .NET Framework. You can use C# to create traditional
Windows client applications, XML Web services,distributed components,
client-server applications, database applications, and much,much more.

Difference between C# and .NET Framework:

C# programs run on the .NET Framework, an integral component of Windows that includes a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a unified set of class libraries. The CLR is the commercial implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard that is the basis
for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.
